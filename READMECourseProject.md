## Course Project
You should create one R script as a tidy dataset that does the following:
  
  1. Merges the training and test sets to create one dataset.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.
  4. Appropriately labels the dataset with descriptive activity names.
  5. Creates a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each varaible for each activity and each subject.
  
## To work on this project:
  1. Download the source data and install in your documents folder.
  2. You will have a UCI HAR Dataset folder.
  3. Run source("run_analysis.R"). It will generate a new file tidy_data.txt in your working directory.
  
## Dependencies
  1. reshape2
  2. data.table
